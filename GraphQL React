npm install @apollo/client graphql
@apollo/client: ^4.0.4 ✅
graphql: ^16.11.0 ✅
No errors found - all linter checks pass!
To use GraphQL:
Start the backend (with GraphQL dependencies)
Start the frontend
Navigate to "GraphQL Demo" in the sidebar
See tweets fetched via GraphQL instead of REST
The GraphQL endpoint will be available at http://localhost:5454/graphql and the frontend will automatically use it when you visit the GraphQL Demo page. All existing REST functionality continues to work normally.
